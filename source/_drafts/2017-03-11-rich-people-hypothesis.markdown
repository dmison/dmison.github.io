Something which has always confused me is the way very rich and privileged people will act to improve their wealth or status.  They will put a lot of effort into something that helps them a tiny bit despite huge negative consequences for others and massive social blow back on them.  Like reducing tax by a percent or two while cutting social programs.  

This makes no sense to me.
