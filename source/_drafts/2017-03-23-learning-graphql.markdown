I kind of went backwards into learning GraphQL.

1. heard mention of it when it was open sourced, GraphQL/Relay ... brief glance, didn't make much sense to me.  Seemed to be something that was great for facebook but I didn't have time to build a server again
2. podcast
3. youtube tutorial -> build awful copy/paste server
4. learnGraphQL.com -> some aha moments, errors led me to GraphQL docs (which made sense)
5. GraphQL offical docs
